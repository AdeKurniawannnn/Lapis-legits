# Title: Develop Landing Page with Initial Video Transitions
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the main landing page with basic scroll-triggered video sections implementing initial transition effects.
# Details:
Design and implement the landing page layout with hero section featuring the first video element. Add 2-3 additional scroll sections with video backgrounds. Implement basic fade transitions between video sections using the scroll detection system. Create responsive behavior for these sections across desktop, tablet and mobile. Add placeholder text and navigation elements. Optimize initial load time by using compressed video formats and implementing lazy loading. Ensure smooth scrolling behavior with debounced scroll events.

# Test Strategy:
Test scrolling performance on multiple devices. Measure time to first meaningful paint. Verify transitions work smoothly at various scroll speeds. Test with throttled network conditions.
