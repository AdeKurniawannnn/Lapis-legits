# Description: Create the portfolio page with video thumbnails and basic playback functionality to showcase LAPIS's work.
# Details:
Design and implement a grid-based portfolio layout with video thumbnails. Create thumbnail components that load video previews efficiently. Implement click-to-expand functionality for full-screen video playback. Add basic filtering capability by project category. Include project metadata display (client, date, services provided). Ensure responsive grid layout that adjusts columns based on screen size. Implement keyboard navigation for accessibility. Add placeholder content for development and testing.

# Test Strategy:
Test thumbnail loading performance. Verify full-screen playback works across browsers. Test keyboard navigation and accessibility with screen readers. Confirm responsive behavior on various screen sizes.
