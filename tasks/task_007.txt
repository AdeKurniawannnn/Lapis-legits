# Task ID: 7
# Title: Enhance Video Transitions and Effects
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Upgrade the video transition system with advanced blending effects and optimized performance.
# Details:
Implement canvas-based video blending for seamless transitions between sections. Add multiple transition effects (fade, zoom, blur, etc.) that can be configured per section. Optimize rendering performance using requestAnimationFrame and hardware acceleration. Implement video quality switching based on device capabilities and connection speed. Add preloading strategy that anticipates user scroll direction. Create fallback experiences for browsers with limited support. Document transition API for future content updates.

# Test Strategy:
Benchmark performance before and after enhancements. Test CPU and memory usage during transitions. Verify transitions work across different browsers and devices. Test fallback experience on older browsers. Measure impact on battery life for mobile devices.
