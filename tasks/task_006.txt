# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a functional contact form with validation and submission handling for client inquiries.
# Details:
Design and implement contact form UI with fields for name, email, project details, service interests, budget range, and timeline. Add client-side form validation with helpful error messages. Create form submission handler that connects to a serverless function. Implement success/error states and messages. Store submissions in a database (consider Firebase or similar service for MVP). Set up email notification system for new inquiries. Add honeypot fields and rate limiting for spam protection.

# Test Strategy:
Test form validation with various input scenarios. Verify submission process works end-to-end. Test error handling with network failures. Validate email notifications are delivered properly. Test form accessibility with keyboard navigation and screen readers.
