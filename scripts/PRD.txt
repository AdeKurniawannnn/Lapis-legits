2. Simple portfolio → Categorized gallery → Interactive showcase
3. Service descriptions → Service examples → Interactive service exploration
4. Basic contact → Enhanced inquiry → Automated follow-up system

# Risks and Mitigations  
Technical Challenges:
1. Video Performance
   - Risk: Large video files causing slow loading and poor performance
   - Mitigation: Implement adaptive streaming, compression, and preloading techniques

2. Cross-Browser Compatibility
   - Risk: Advanced video effects not working consistently across browsers
   - Mitigation: Use progressive enhancement and fallback options for older browsers

3. Mobile Experience
   - Risk: Video-heavy experience consuming excessive bandwidth on mobile
   - Mitigation: Develop mobile-specific optimizations and alternative experiences

MVP Considerations:
1. Balancing Visual Impact vs. Performance
   - Risk: Overemphasis on visual effects at the expense of usability
   - Mitigation: Establish core performance metrics and test regularly

2. Content Management Complexity
   - Risk: Difficult for client to update video content independently
   - Mitigation: Develop intuitive CMS with clear documentation

Resource Constraints:
1. Video Production Requirements
   - Risk: Need for extensive custom video content for the website itself
   - Mitigation: Design system to work with existing portfolio content initially
